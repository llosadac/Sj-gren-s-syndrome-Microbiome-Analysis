# Sjogren-s-syndrome-Microbiome-Analysis

The impact of the clinical manifestations of Sjögren’s syndrome considerably affects the quality of life of those who suffer from it, reducing their well-being. Owing to the multifactorial nature of the syndrome, some individuals present alterations in oral microbiota profiles, which are influenced by genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. This study describes the oral cavity microbiota profiles of patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome and determines the differentially abundant taxa that could constitute potential biomarkers associated with the disease on the basis of a metagenomic data mining approach of patients diagnosed with Sjögren’s syndrome and healthy individuals. A total of 242 samples—168 from the pSS group and 74 from the control group—were analyzed using the metabarcoding technique on the basis of sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Data processing, inference of amplicon sequence variants, and taxonomic assignment were performed using DADA2, and statistical and microbial diversity analyses were performed using the phyloseq package in R. Alpha and beta diversity metrics were evaluated to compare microbial composition and structure between groups, as well as the identification of enriched taxa through linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe). The results revealed no significant differences in the composition and structure of the microbiota between groups according to relative abundance and diversity analyses. However, the analysis of differentially abundant taxa allowed the identification of 27 markers, including the species Actinomyces dentocariosa; the genera Streptococcus, Leptotrichia, Veillonella, Fusobacterium, and Alloprevotella; and phyla such as Actinobacteriota and Fusobacteriota, in the pSS group samples. Although no direct associations have yet been established between oral microbiota taxa and Sjögren’s syndrome, some of the identified genera have been documented to possess pathogenic factors that induce immune responses and are associated with hyposalivation and other oral conditions. In this context, this study lays the groundwork for future analyses of oral microbiota profiles in patients with autoimmune diseases, particularly Sjögren’s syndrome, to deepen the understanding of potential associations between the microbiota and the disease, which could support new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies aimed at microbiome regulation and the management of Sjögren’s syndrome manifestations.
